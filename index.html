        <p>
          To maintain Europe's leading role in QT, knowledge and technology transfer from research to industry must be ensured. 
          Due to the complexity of the subject, innovative education and training formats â€“ such as interactive hands-on learning â€“ are necessary for knowledge transfer. 
        </p>

        <p>
          The virtual user facility is to be such a format. For this purpose, the ion trap user facility already available at PTB is to be converted into a digital twin. 
          In this way, potential users can already gain experience with the digital, interactive and three-dimensional model before they work with the real ion trap facility.
